# Weather App

Working through creating this app is a good way to learn about API's and Tkinter in Python 3.

## Notes

It uses the OpenWeatherMap.org API, available [here](https://openweathermap.org/). You'll need your own API key to get started.

A great Tkinter resource is available [here](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/). Note that it's written for Python 2, but my code is in Python 3.

There are also images of a snowman and sandcastle used in this project that are not included in the git repo.

Enjoy!
